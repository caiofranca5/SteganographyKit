# SteganographyKit

<p align="center">
SteganographyKit is an iOS framework designed to seamlessly integrate steganography into mobile applications. It provides developers with a simple and efficient way to embed and extract hidden messages or data within images. Featuring an easy-to-use public interface, the kit ensures secure and subtle data encoding, making it ideal for applications requiring confidentiality, like secure messaging or digital watermarking.

## Features

- [x] Add SteganographyKit features

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `SteganographyKit` in action. Simply open the `SteganographyKit.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/caiofranca5/SteganographyKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `SteganographyKit`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate SteganographyKit into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
